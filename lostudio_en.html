								On March 6, 2014, he was remembered during the second European day of the 
								Righteous with the laying of a memorial stone and the planting of a tree.<br>

								like their father Giuseppe, were imprisoned during Italy’s Fascist Era), proficiently
								carried out their professional activities with constant growth, 
								always maintaining the law firm’s family imprint.<br>
